# First Aid and Emergency App using (Android Studio):

**A Mobile Application Development Mini Project on: First Aid Application**

**Introduction**

In an emergency, we might only have a few seconds to save a life. Is there anything we can do in an emergency to wait for help? Because we might only be able to rely on ourselves, we should act. First aid is the immediate care provided to an accident or illness victim before emergency medical assistance arrives. In various cases, including heart attacks where someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving procedure or strategy. It is a technique that combines chest compressions and rescue breathing to keep the blood flowing to the brain while the heart is not beating.
Imagine if one day we discover our friend unconscious and on the floor. We run to contact the ambulance without knowing how long he has been there. That person is helpless while the ambulance is en route, and we are unable to assist him. Wouldn't you wish to have the abilities required to assist in saving him? Learning CPR is essential because it may be the difference between life and death. Additionally, sling injuries are the most common among teenagers and high school students. When one of our pals breaks an arm outside, the first thing we need to do is get him to support the arm with his hand. The lower end of the bandage should then be raised over the hand and forearm and tied in the hollow above the collarbone. After that, tuck the point in or twist it close to the elbow. In our daily lives, having first aid knowledge and skills is really vital.

**Aims and Objectives**

The project's main aim is to create a first aid mobile application that is packed with knowledge about how to administer first aid in various emergency scenarios.
Goal of the Project
The initiative specifically attempts to accomplish the following goals :
1. To create an application that instructs the user in first aid utilizing that application.
2. The application will include first aid procedures for various illnesses and injuries.
3. To give users a means of communication with emergency hotlines following the administration of first aid.
The software is precise and trustworthy. The Development tools used are Java and android studio.
4. Professional Medical Respondents. The application will help them in their work given that the patient was already given first aid; there is a high chance of saving the patient.


**Functional requirement**

In software engineering, a functional requirement defines a function of a software system or its component. A function is described as a set of inputs, the behaviour, and outputs (see also software).
Functional requirements may be calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing, and other specific functionality that define what a system is supposed to accomplish. Behavioural requirements describing all the cases where the system uses the functional requirements are captured in use cases.
1.  Android Phone; To perform and display the functionality of the project.
2.  Android studio; To create, design, test, debug and run the android project.
3.  Mouse; To navigate through the emulator
